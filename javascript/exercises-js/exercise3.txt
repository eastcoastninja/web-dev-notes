// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!


var firstNum = prompt("What is your first number?");
var secondNum = prompt("What is your second number?");

firstNum = Number(firstNum);
secondNum = Number(secondNum);

var add = firstNum + secondNum;
var sub = firstNum - secondNum;
var multiply = firstNum * secondNum;
var divide = firstNum / secondNum;

alert("The added sum is: " + add);
alert("The subtracted sum is: " + sub);
alert("The multiplied sum is: " + multiply);
alert("The divided sum is: " + divide);
