## About myself
Been coding for a year and some change and I absolutely love it
Love the creativiy, problem solving, and the feeling when something just works.
Community - smart thoughtful people want you to see you succeed 
Outside of coding 
I like to be on the adventureous side.
Being in front of a computer most of the time makes the beautity of nature and its just something that's really hard to replicate in a digital world.

# Interview Questions?

## Why Telsa?
Like I mentioned earlier I appreciate nature
I believe Telsa's mission towards a sustainable energy lines up with my beliefs of wanting to leave the world a better place than I found it.
I like Telsa how seemless Telsa's designs look. I was browsing the solar roof and I thought so where are the ugly bulky panels and went WOOOOW the tech is built into the panels that's so COOOL!



## Code
When I get stuck I follow the algorithm of read-search-ask
	read documention or error
	search google
	ask friends for help

Two different functions for reversing a string

one using a for loop
I did 
String is an array of characters 

## Projects
Latest project was creating a web app with react. Still trying to figure it out but it's been a lot of fun. I like how I can build multiple components to fit into a container.
	Reuseablity makes things alot easier than reinventing the wheel.
This web app has a database that allows you to filter through based on the user input provided.


## Resume
School Experience - 
Have working with groups on both technical and non-technical projects (from debates to a java based theater app)
	My team and I created a couple different classes that would communicate with a main class to organize showtimes and availablity. I created sort of like a template for the classes we needed like seat, theater, and customer. I also created functions for reserving a seat and returning a seat status (available or not)

On the job experience -
	I learned a lot in my current position about the business industry.
	I adapted well under pressure to meet deadlines and get the job done with limited resources.
		My department is a small team maybe 10 and we ship multimillion dollar products on a daily basis.
		My role has increased in the short amount of time I've been in the department. My primary job is shipping but I cover for receipts on a frequent basis. 
	I lead big campaigns so when a large shipment is due to ship I assemble a team and designate tasks that to be complete.
	I learn things on the fly and push through any obstacle that gets in the way.
		Often times there is an issue and I dig through the problem to find a solution.
			We use an old multi-user multitasking system the AS400 that runs into odd issues. 
	I effectively communicate any problems I can not solve.

## Comments
I just want to comment that the javascript code for the telsa website is really well written and documented. 

I really like the layout of telsa webpages the transitions are so smooth and sleek. I really want to learn more about how they work especially the animations. It's really impressive.
